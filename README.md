##PDF output

##Problems:

I had some seriously frustrating struggles with this code at first. Mostly because it worked once and then somehow broke the second time I ran the code without making any changes... I still have no clue why my code was breaking but I decided to restructure it and it worked again miraculously the first time and again broke the second time without making any changes. Again, I had no clue what was causing this and am still baffled. However, after a third restructure, the code began working reliably!!!

My second issue was with my pdf output not matching my html output. I had to make some slight changes to the styling that would not negativly affect the HTML (which was displaying perfectly) while somehow providing the pdf generating module the info it apparently needed to display properly.
